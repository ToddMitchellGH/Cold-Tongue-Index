# Cold-Tongue-Index

The cold tongue index (CTI) is defined to be average sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies for 6N-6S, 180-90W minus the global-mean SST anomaly Deser and Wallace (1990, J. Climate). The global-mean SST is an estimate of the radiative heating of the ocean due to increased greeenhouse gases.  

The CTI captures a lower-frequency signal of the El Ni√±o / Southern Oscillation phenomenon than the Nino3.4 index, which is decribed at https://github.com/ToddMitchellGH/ENSO-nino3.4-timeseries/blob/master/README.md.  That README.md also documents the temperature and precipitation anomalies associated with fluctuations in the CTI/Nino3.4.
